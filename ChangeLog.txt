   * v1.0 (2004-01-04) - first release
       ! solved FlySpray task #147
         http://psi.affinix.com/flyspray/?do=details&id=147
   * v1.1 (2004-01-07) 
       ! changed compiller to: MakeNSIS v2.0rc2
         (some installer translations have been updated)
       + created new install/uninstall icons
       ! reorganized the options for the shortcuts (simplified the structure)
       ! reorganized the code (much more modular)
       + made the installer fully translateable using exterior language files
   * v1.2 (2004-01-11)
       ! reorganized language detection & string assigning
       ! fixed translation display
   * v1.3 (2004-01-20)
       ! replaced some explicit refrences to Psi 0.9.1 with global variables
       ! the installer saves properly the language used for the installation
         and automatically selects it on uninstall
       + installer saves the version of Psi it installs in a reg key
         FlySpray: http://psi.affinix.com/flyspray/index.php?do=details&id=35
   * v1.4 (2004-02-01)
       + created ChangeLog.txt for tracking easier the changes in the installer
       - removed ChangeLog section from ReadME.txt
       + added compile directive BUIL_WITH_LANGPACKS - allows installer builds
         that do not include language packs 
       - removed psi-base.nsi from the installer files
         (same effect can be obtained by using commenting BUIL_WITH_LANGPACKS)
       + added INSTALLER_BUILD number, to allow tracking the installer rebuilds
         for the same APPVERSION
       + moved installer language includes to a separate file
       ! optimized code
   * v1.5 (2004-02-08)
       + added compile directive LANG_TEST_BUILD to build installers only for
         language tests (installer languages & Psi languages packs)
       ! minor build improvements (added LCAPPNAME - lowercase AppName)
       - removed redundant code from the install section
   * v1.6 (2004-06-10)
       ! updated for Psi 0.9.2 release
       ! fixed uninstall (previous version removed the entire folder, including
         custom iconsets/sounds/certs) - now it only deletes the files installed
       ! installer now quits if Cancel is pressed when the user is told that the
         (un)install can not continue because Psi is already running
         (previous version continued (un)install if Cancel was pressed)
       + separated the (un)install file lists for easier management
         (psi_files_install.nsi & psi_files_uninstall.nsi)
    * v1.7 (2005-01-30)
       ! updated for Psi 0.9.3 release
       ! silent uninstall of previous version, after warning the user
       ! clarified the upgrade warning
       ! cleanup: moved the string init functions to installer-functions.nsh
         as a macro
       ! checking for a running Psi version is done before testing for a
         previously installed version
       + added APPEXTRAVERSION variable to define non-final release versions
       ! packages including Psi language packs will be suffixed by "-i18n"
         and base packages will have no suffix
       ! sorted the installer languages alphabetically
       ! fixed auto_uninstall (thanks Michal)
    * v2.0beta (2005-09-25)
       + separated Psi language files & setup
       + added tools/prepfiles, tools/preplang scripts for easy management
